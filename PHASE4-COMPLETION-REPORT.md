## System Architecture

### Firebase Integration Flow
```
User Authentication → Firestore Database → Real-time Sync → Conflict Resolution
     ↓                      ↓                    ↓              ↓
Device Registration → Encrypted Storage → Google Drive → Migration Tools
```

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: Multi-provider auth with automatic profile creation
2. **Storage**: Encrypted local storage with cloud backup
3. **Sync**: Real-time synchronization with conflict resolution
4. **Backup**: Automated encrypted backups to Google Drive
5. **Migration**: Automatic data format upgrades

## Security Features

### Data Protection
