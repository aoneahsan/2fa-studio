# Security Best Practices

Learn how to maximize your security when using 2FA Studio and protect your accounts from unauthorized access.

## Understanding 2FA Security

### What is Two-Factor Authentication?

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring:
1. **Something you know** (password)
2. **Something you have** (your phone with 2FA codes)

This means even if someone steals your password, they can't access your accounts without your 2FA device.

### How 2FA Studio Protects You

- **End-to-end encryption**: All secrets are encrypted on your device
- **Biometric protection**: Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint lock
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: We never see your unencrypted data
- **Local processing**: Codes generated on-device, not in cloud

## Setting Up Maximum Security

### 1. Secure Your Device First

#### Mobile Security
- Enable device lock screen (PIN/Pattern/Biometric)
- Keep your OS updated
- Only install apps from official stores
- Enable "Find My Device" features

#### App Security
```
Settings > Security > Enable All:
âœ“ Biometric Unlock
âœ“ App Lock on Background
âœ“ Screenshot Protection
âœ“ Clipboard Auto-Clear
```

### 2. Master Password Best Practices

#### Creating a Strong Master Password

**DO:**
- Use 15+ characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Make it memorable but unique
- Use a passphrase approach

**DON'T:**
- Reuse passwords from other services
- Use personal information
- Write it down insecurely
- Share it with anyone

#### Good Password Examples
```
Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple-2024!
MyD0g$Name1sMax&HeL0vesTreats
Time2Secure*All#My@Accounts
```

### 3. Biometric Security

#### Enable Biometric Lock
1. Go to **Settings** > **Security**
2. Enable **Biometric Unlock**
3. Register your biometrics
4. Set fallback method

#### Biometric Best Practices
- Register multiple fingers (if using fingerprint)
- Re-register if biometrics change significantly
- Use biometrics as convenience, not sole protection
- Always have master password as backup

## Account Security

### Adding Accounts Safely

#### QR Code Scanning
1. **Verify the source**: Only scan from legitimate websites
2. **Check the URL**: Ensure you're on the correct domain
3. **Look for HTTPS**: Never add 2FA on insecure sites
4. **Verify issuer**: Confirm the service name matches

#### Manual Entry
When entering secrets manually:
- Double-check every character
- Never share secrets via email/chat
- Delete secret from clipboard after entry
- Verify the code works immediately

### Organizing Accounts

#### Use Categories
```
Work/
â”œâ”€â”€ Email
â”œâ”€â”€ Slack
â”œâ”€â”€ GitHub
â””â”€â”€ AWS

Personal/
â”œâ”€â”€ Banking
â”œâ”€â”€ Social Media
â”œâ”€â”€ Shopping
â””â”€â”€ Email

Crypto/
â”œâ”€â”€ Exchanges
â”œâ”€â”€ Wallets
â””â”€â”€ DeFi
```

#### Security Labels
Add security level indicators:
- ðŸ”´ **Critical**: Banking, primary email
- ðŸŸ¡ **Important**: Work accounts, crypto
- ðŸŸ¢ **Standard**: Social media, shopping

## Backup Security

### Encryption Standards

All backups use:
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption
- **PBKDF2** key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- **Random salts** per backup
- **HMAC** authentication

### Backup Password Requirements

Create a unique backup password:
1. Different from master password
2. Equally strong (15+ characters)
3. Store securely (password manager)
4. Never use for other services

### Secure Backup Storage

#### Cloud Backups
- Enable 2FA on Google account
- Use strong Google password
- Review account permissions regularly
- Monitor access logs

#### Local Backups
- Encrypt before storing
- Use secure storage locations
- Don't email backup files
- Consider offline storage for critical backups

## Sync Security

### Device Management

#### Adding New Devices
1. Only add devices you own
2. Verify device ID during pairing
3. Name devices descriptively
4. Review device list monthly

#### Removing Devices
```
Settings > Devices > [Select Device] > Remove
```
Remove devices when:
- Selling/giving away device
- Device is lost/stolen
- No longer using device
- Suspicious activity detected

### Sync Best Practices

- **Enable sync only on trusted networks**
- **Review sync logs regularly**
- **Limit number of active devices**
- **Use device-specific permissions**

## Browser Extension Security

### Installation Safety

1. **Only install from Chrome Web Store**
2. **Verify publisher is "2FA Studio"**
3. **Check reviews and ratings**
4. **Review requested permissions**

### Usage Security

#### Website Verification
Before auto-filling codes:
- Verify exact domain match
- Check for HTTPS
- Look for visual indicators
- Confirm no typos in URL

#### Permission Management
```
Extension Settings > Permissions:
- Auto-fill: Require approval
- Clipboard: Clear after 30 seconds
- Notifications: Essential only
```

## Network Security

### Safe Networks

**Use 2FA Studio on:**
- Home WiFi (WPA3 preferred)
- Cellular data
- Trusted work networks
- VPN connections

**Avoid using on:**
- Public WiFi
- Hotel networks
- Airport/cafe hotspots
- Untrusted networks

### VPN Usage

When on public networks:
1. Connect to trusted VPN first
2. Verify VPN is active
3. Then use 2FA Studio
4. Disconnect when done

## Recovery Security

### Backup Codes

#### Storing Backup Codes
- **Physical**: Safe, safety deposit box
- **Digital**: Encrypted password manager
- **Split**: Part in each location
- **Never**: Plain text, email, cloud notes

#### Using Backup Codes
- Use only when necessary
- Mark used codes immediately
- Generate new set after use
- Update all backup locations

### Account Recovery

#### Preparation
1. Document recovery methods
2. Keep recovery info updated
3. Test recovery process
4. Have backup access methods

#### Recovery Security
- Never share recovery codes
- Verify support channels
- Use official recovery processes
- Document recovery attempts

## Threat Protection

### Common Threats

#### Phishing Attacks
**Protection:**
- Verify all 2FA setup requests
- Check email sender addresses
- Never enter 2FA codes on suspicious sites
- Report phishing attempts

#### SIM Swapping
**Protection:**
