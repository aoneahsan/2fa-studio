## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript/TypeScript Styleguide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep files under 500 lines (create smaller, reusable components)

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use named exports for better refactoring support
- Place component files in appropriate directories

### Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for critical user flows
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Additional Notes

### Security Considerations

Given the sensitive nature of 2FA applications:
- Never log or expose secret keys
- Always use encryption for sensitive data
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Report security vulnerabilities privately

### Dependencies

- Always use `yarn` for package management
- Update dependencies to latest versions regularly
- Document why specific versions are pinned (if any)
