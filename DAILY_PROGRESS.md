# Daily Progress Tracker - 2FA Studio

## January 14, 2025

### üéØ Today's Goals
- [x] Assess project status
- [x] Create completion plan
- [x] Fix admin page exports
- [x] Add missing UI components
- [x] Initialize Android platform
- [x] Initialize iOS platform
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript errors
- [ ] Get yarn dev running
- [ ] Test core 2FA functionality

### ‚úÖ Completed Today
1. **Project Assessment**
   - Identified 85+ TypeScript errors
   - Found browser extension is 100% complete
   - Discovered mobile platforms weren't initialized

2. **Build Fixes**
   - Fixed admin page default exports
   - Created missing UI input component
   - Added clsx and tailwind-merge dependencies
   - Fixed button variant types (default ‚Üí primary, destructive ‚Üí danger)
   - Fixed BuildKit UI import issues

3. **Platform Setup**
   - Successfully added Android platform
   - Successfully added iOS platform
   - Created .env file from template

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive PROJECT_COMPLETION_PLAN.md
   - Defined 4-week roadmap to production
   - Prioritized features (P0-P3)

### üöß In Progress
- Fixing remaining ~70 TypeScript errors
- Creating missing service methods

### üî¥ Blockers
1. **Missing firebase.service.ts** - Needs creation
2. **EncryptionService methods** - Several methods not implemented
3. **Package type definitions** - Some packages lack TypeScript types

### üìä Metrics
- **Build Errors**: 85+ ‚Üí ~70 (18% reduction)
- **Platforms Ready**: 1/4 ‚Üí 3/4 (browser ext, Android, iOS)
- **Core Features Working**: 0% (blocked by build errors)

### üéØ Tomorrow's Priority
1. Fix all remaining TypeScript errors
2. Get development server running
3. Test core 2FA account creation and code generation
4. Set up Firebase project

### üìù Notes
- Browser extension can be released immediately (fully functional)
- Mobile platforms initialized but need web build to work
- Admin panel structure exists but needs error fixes
- Firebase functions ready but need configuration

---

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Fix before features** - Prioritizing build fixes over new features
2. **Core first** - Focusing on basic 2FA before advanced features
3. **Iterative release** - Plan to release browser extension first
4. **4-week timeline** - Aggressive but achievable with focused effort

---

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: TypeScript errors could hide runtime issues
- **Medium Risk**: App store approval delays
- **Low Risk**: Browser extension (already complete)

---

## Next Session Handoff
**Priority**: Continue fixing TypeScript errors in this order:
1. firebase.service.ts creation
2. EncryptionService methods
3. Storage/Preferences imports
4. Toast notification types

**Test After Fixes**:
```bash
yarn dev  # Should start without crashing
```

Then test:
1. Add account manually
2. View TOTP code
3. Copy to clipboard
4. Refresh - data persists
