let's plan a project

want to create a 2FA service providing app

like "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twofasapp&hl=en"

want to add thes features mainly at least

- 2fa code creating
- secure as much as possible
- biometric auth
- extension for browser, starting with chrome like "https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/2fas-auth-two-factor-auth/dbfoemgnkgieejfkaddieamagdfepnff"
- scan qr codes or add manual code to get the 2FA code for the site
- ability to store backup codes for a site, based on user preference
  - keep record of used codes, ask user if it was used properly or not
- google drive backup with full encrypption of data before storing it on google drive
  - user should connect their google drive account for google drive backup, again we should properly and securely encrypt data before storing it on their google drive
- codes import and export to encrypted file functionality, so users will be able to exports codes from 1 phone and import on other phone in our app using the encrypted file our app provides

which framework i should use for website and mobile app (android and IOS) development?

react + capacitorJs
or
Flutter

and for app/project backend i want to use firebase, DB firestore, and other services of firebase

just for record i have these packages i created for capacitor+react projects

https://npmjs.com/package/capacitor-auth-manager
https://www.npmjs.com/package/capacitor-biometric-auth
https://www.npmjs.com/package/capacitor-firebase-kit
https://www.npmjs.com/package/capacitor-native-update
https://www.npmjs.com/package/buildkit-ui

so i think maybe for now we should go with react+capacitor?

and how will we develop the extension for the project, i want the extension to work better, like "https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj", mean user with just the extension installed on browser should be able to keep verifying these 2FA codes on website without having to approve them again and again on/from their phone, but for security user should have to approve these requested at least once per day for one browser profile, mainly user should get option like (a dropdown), don't ask on this profile for next "30minutes/1hour/2hour/6hour/12hour/24hour" making it easy for user to keep going without interuption and still have properly security in place

and we need to make sure to manage user devices as well, like where user have installed/loggedin his account, and user should be able to manage that using his mobile app only for security reasons, and should be able to invalidate any other device including other phones and browser extensions from phone.

make sure to create this app with features-tags, subscription plans, google ads places in app (should be controlable through admin panel), and users role & permissions

and a full control access admin panel, to control users, thir subscription plans, features allowed to users, or to subscription plans

basically we should have two ways to earn from this app, 1 from subscriptions that users buy and then they should get higher usage limits and better features and options and other for free plan users "ads in app"

please create a proper plan for this project, and then we will continu from there and develop the whole project

we need to make sure that we create public privacy and other policy related pages in the project, and make sure that our app follows that as well properly
