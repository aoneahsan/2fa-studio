## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT TO ADDRESS

### High Priority
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Proper error boundaries
- Loading states for all async operations
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Medium Priority
- Code splitting for performance
- Service worker for offline support
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Dark mode consistency

### Low Priority
- Animation polish
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts
- Batch operations UI
- Advanced search filters

---

## üìù NOTES

### Current Blockers
1. TypeScript compilation errors preventing build
2. Missing Firebase configuration
3. Some NPM packages need proper TypeScript definitions

### Quick Wins
1. Browser extension is already complete - can release immediately
2. Core TOTP logic exists - just needs error fixes
3. UI components mostly ready - just need wiring

### Risk Areas
1. App store approval process (can take 1-2 weeks)
2. Payment integration complexity
3. Cross-platform testing requirements

---

- [ ] TOTP codes generate correctly  
- [ ] Data syncs across devices
- [ ] Biometric authentication works
- [ ] Free/Premium tiers implemented
- [ ] Apps available in stores
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Basic documentation complete

### Post-MVP Features (v2.0)

- Hardware key support  
- SMS/Voice code fallback
- Advanced backup options
- Password manager integration

## üí° RECOMMENDED APPROACH

1. **Fix builds first** - Can't test without working builds
2. **Focus on core 2FA** - This is the main value proposition  
3. **Add cloud sync** - Key differentiator from offline-only apps
4. **Polish mobile** - Most users will use mobile primarily
5. **Launch iteratively** - Start with web/extension, then mobile

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of good**. Launch with core features working well rather than waiting for every feature to be complete.
