VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
```

### Current State
- App runs with `yarn dev`
- All pages are accessible and functional
- Chrome extension can be loaded unpacked from `chrome-extension/` directory
- Some features show "coming soon" but structure is complete

### Known Issues
1. Biometric auth is stubbed (not working)

3. Payment integration not connected
4. No tests written yet

## 📝 What to Tell Tomorrow

When you continue tomorrow, just say:
> "Continue with the 2FA Studio project. I need to complete the import/export UI modals and integrate Google Drive backup into the settings page."

This will give enough context to continue exactly where we left off.

## 🎉 Progress Summary
