## Next Steps for Mobile Testing

The only remaining task is testing on mobile platforms. Use the Mobile Testing Guide at `/docs/mobile-testing-guide.md` to:

1. Build the app for iOS and Android
2. Test each service on real devices
3. Verify platform-specific features
4. Check performance and battery usage

## Key Achievements

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All migrations maintain backward compatibility
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every service has detailed docs with examples
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support across all services
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling in all services
- **Performance**: Optimized initialization and lazy loading
